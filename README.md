## My process

1. Recreated the design as per [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/MoLwFPHNHJVrzdFurxHzNV/Meme-Generator?node-id=0%3A1)

2. Started with the mockup -- deleteting unrequired files and adding the `component` and `images` files to the structure after `create-react-app`

3. Started with the `Navbar` section using a container to set `max-width`

4. Then the `Main` section with the `inputs`, `button`, and `Meme Image`

5. Writing out this `README.md` file

### Built with

- React
- JSX syntax
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Using Figma files to code

- React! React! React!

### Continued development

- Learning more React! (yeah reenacting React problems and tackling them)

- Better turnaround time -- simple stuff but worked on it for a while

- Less Code (code cleanup)
